# hello-word
A beginner repository to learn the basics of git and github.
I'm interested in a lot of things such as Python, Web development via Django, Data Science, Machine Learning
Control Systems, Simulations and Finite Element Analysis, Hardware (Ardiuno) ,etc.
And I'm hoping that in the next two years I should have mastered all of this to an extent that would make me able to change the world
